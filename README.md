# Welcome to Geotrans lab!

## 1. Introduction
GeoTrans is a laboratory within the Department of Geography at UCSB. It was created in 2004 with the arrival of Professor Konstadinos G. Goulias bringing ideas from the Transportation Operations Program at the Pennsylvania Transportation Institute of PennState merged with Transport Geography at UCSB. This fusion of different transitions created behavioral models that account for activity opportunities in space, applications of data collection and modeling of sense of place in travel behavior, comprehensive access and accessibility computation by different modes and different amenities, novel and advanced time use and travel behavior pattern recognition methods using sequence analysis and complex networks, market analysis of new technologies, and further development of activity-based methods for travel demand analysis and forecasting in domestic agencies and abroad. 

GeoTrans main physical facility is a suite in Ellison Hall. Since 2004 GeoTrans has had 168 projects of approximately $6.6 million plus many graduate and undergraduate student fellowships.

- Update your profile on [Geotrans website](https://geotrans.geog.ucsb.edu/people.html): You may request access to this github repo from Kostas. Once you do that, you will have permission to update the website such as create your own profile and post news and publications.


- Python and R on cloud: 
These are very useful tools offered by the department and Earth Research Institute (ERI) to do heavy computing jobs on the cloud.  
    - First thing to do is to requst an account for yourself. You may send an email to help@eri.ucsb.edu and cc Kostas. 
    - [VPN](https://www.it.ucsb.edu/vpn): All servers can be accessed remotely as long as you have connected campus VPN (even if you are using the campus Wi-Fi, you still need to turn on VPN). Everything regarding how to install VPN and how to use can be found in via the link.
    - [Jupyter](https://wiki-sysadm.eri.ucsb.edu/Jupyter): Jupyter notebook on the server is the most convenient way to run python scripts.
    - [R](https://wiki-sysadm.eri.ucsb.edu/R): They also offer R Studio on the server. 

- [Box](https://ucsb.app.box.com/) for cloud storage: We use Box to store and share digital products including papers, code and data. You can acess Box with your UCSB credential. 

- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/): Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor we use to write papers together. If you haven't used LaTex before, you may find tutorials online easily. You will need your UCSB credential to register an account. Only the PI can request a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSfuuV4gZ-Bb1QPA02of398l1_1Wy6ZRhNBW90JnQ10TBQbmBA/viewform" target="_blank">professional account</a> for the lab graduate students free of charge. A professional account will allow you to track changes when collaborating on projects and unlimited historical version access.  


- Publishing your research: Gradute students can apply [UCSB Open Access Publishing Fund](https://www.library.ucsb.edu/ucsb-open-access-publishing-fund) to cover the publication fee to make your research open to public.
